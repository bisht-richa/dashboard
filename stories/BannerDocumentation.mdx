### States

<br/>

#### Primary

Primary alerts are triggered by system events. They appear as a fixed, full-width strip, on top of the screen throughout the application.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-banner--primary" />
</Canvas>

#### Info
Info alerts should be used when there are tips or information that a user can benefit from.

<Canvas>    
  <Story id="components-banner--info" />
</Canvas>

#### Warning
Warning alerts should be used for messages that likely require attention.
<Canvas>    
  <Story id="components-banner--warning" />
</Canvas>

#### Error
Danger alerts should be used when the system has failed to perform an action, or when the user has made an error. * Never include a close icon or link to dismiss the action. In cases when the alert should be dismissible use a warning alert instead. In many cases like this, the user path can be changed to achieve better results without requiring a close button in the component.

  <Story id="components-banner--error" />
</Canvas>

### Accessibility
Badges are suitable for use as counters, for example to indicate the number of notifications.

- The use of color to add meaning provides only a visual cue and does not convey information to the assistive technology user.
- Use visually hidden text to convey meaning to assertive technologies. We recommend using the .sr-only class.
