### States

<br/>

#### Primary

Primary banner are triggered by system events. They appear as a fixed, full-width strip, on top of the screen throughout the application.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Primary"
    args={{
      label:    'Banner Component - Primary',
      closable: false,
      color:    'primary',
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Info
Info alerts should be used when there are tips or information that a user can benefit from. They are display in the section of the application related to the information.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Info"
    args={{
      label:    'Banner Component - Info',
      closable: false,
      color:    'info',
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Warning
Warning banner should be used for messages that likely require attention. They are display in the section of the application related to the information.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Warning"
    args={{
      label:    'Banner Component - Warning',
      closable: false,
      color:    'warning',
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Error
Danger banners should be used when the system has failed to perform an action, or when the user has made an error. * Never include a "close" icon or link to dismiss the action. In cases when the alert should be dismissible use a warning banner instead. In many cases like this, the user path can be changed to achieve better results without requiring a close button in the component. They are display in the section of the application related to the information.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Error"
    args={{
      label:    'Banner Component - Error',
      closable: false,
      color:    'error',
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


### Accessibility
Badges are suitable for use as counters, for example to indicate the number of notifications.

- The use of color to add meaning provides only a visual cue and does not convey information to the assistive technology user.
- Use visually hidden text to convey meaning to assertive technologies. We recommend using the .sr-only class.
